on the page you can scroll down to see the rest of the results and different information about each of them. 

## Summary

This webpage gives a great overview of UFO sightings in the US, but it does have a few shortcomings. The biggest one is that does not have the functionality to add live data as it comes in. The data that is a part of the data file will stay the same unless someone manually goes in and updates it.

The two recommendations for future changes I can think of would be to implement live data functionality and be able to do some work on the comments.
